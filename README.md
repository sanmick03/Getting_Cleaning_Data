# Description

The requirements are:
 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
 - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
## Functions
 
`merge_data` which will handle the the 1st, 3rd, and 4th requirements
`extract_mean_std` which will handle the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th requirements
`melt_data_and_write_tidy_set` which will handle the 5th requirement and write out the tidy set file

A helper function `read_tidy_set` is provided to read the generated tidy_set inside R.

### merge_data

Purpose: to merge all the data from the various text files into a single giant data table. No subset or extractions performed on the data set once merged.
 
 Parameters: 
    `directory`: a character vector that indicates the folder residing inside the working directory
    
 Value:
    `all_data`: a merged data table containing training and test data and 3 additional columns for subject, activity, and activity id. This amounts to 10299 observations of 564 variables
    
### extract_mean_std

 Purpose: Performs subset on the giant data set of merged data to extract just the mean and std related data

 Parameters: 
    `data_set`: a data table containing the training set and test set data and 3 additional columns for subject, activity, and activity id
    `directory`: a character vector that indicates the folder residing inside the working directory
    
 Value:
    `extracted_data_set`: after performing subset on the `data_set` parameter, this is a data table that contains just 10299 observations of 69 variables basically the same 3 additional columns of subject, activity, and activity id plus the 66 columns whose headers contain the characters `mean()` and `std()`
    
### melt_data_and_write_tidy_set

 Purpose: Performs melt data, casting back to tidy data format, and then writing the data out to a text file

 Parameters: 
    `extracted_mean_std_data_set`: a data table containing the training set and test set data and 3 additional columns for subject, activity, and activity id but has already extracted out the mean and std columns
    `path_to_tidyset_file`: a character vector that indicates the path to write the tidy set file to 
    
 Value:
    nil
    
### read_tidy_set

 Purpose: Reads the tidy set file back into data table

 Parameters: 
    `path_to_tidyset_file`: a character vector that indicates the path to the tidy set file
    
 Value:
    datatable of data inside the tidy set file
